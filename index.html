        <h1>Gradient of Scalar Field</h1>

        <p>
            The gradient of a scalar function is a basic topic in vector calculus
            that has widespread uses in Physics and Engineering. For example, let
            \(\mathbf{F}\) be a given <em>conservative</em> force, i.e., a force
            such that the work done in moving a particle from a point \(A\) to a
            point \(B\) is independent of the path taken. This means that if we
            start and end our trajectory in the same place, i.e. \(A = B\), then
            the work done must be zero, no matter the path, since by definition of
            a conservative force, any path must be equivalent to the path in which
            no distance is travelled. So for a closed trajectory \(C\),
        </p>

        \[W = \oint_C \mathbf{F} \cdot d\mathbf{r} = 0.\]

        <p>
            Now let \(c\) be a simple (no self-intersections) curve from the origin
            to some point \(x\) in space. Then we can defined a scalar function
            called the <em>potential at \(x\)</em>,
        </p>

        \[\phi(x) = - \int_c \mathbf{F} \cdot d\mathbf{r}.\]

        <p>
            By our equation above, we know that this integral must be the same for
            any choice of path \(c\) so long as it starts at the origin, and ends
            at \(x\), so the function \(\phi(x)\) has one well-defined value
            independent of the choice of \(c\). Now, by the fundamental theorem
            of calculus, we have that,
        </p>

        \[\phi(x) = \int_c \nabla \phi \cdot d\mathbf{r},\]

        <p>
            and hence we have that \(\mathbf{F} = -\nabla \phi\). So any conservative
            force is simply the negative gradient of some potential. This is useful
            in many places, for one it is easier to work with a scalar potential
            then a force field, since we only have to consider scalar values rather
            than vectors (which have three components in space).
        </p>

        <p>
            It is also useful to
            build the intuition of potential as being a hill which a ball rolls down.
            Below you will see that the gradient will always point in the direction in
            which the scalar function is increasing the most quickly, so at a given
            point a conservative force will always point in the direction that the
            potential is <em>decreasing</em> most quickly, due to the minus sign.
            Hence, the force will always act in the direction that tries to minimise
            the potential energy, until we reach some kind of minimum. In fact,
            the minus sign was introduced for just this reason. If the minus
            sign were not there, then for a particle with energy \(E = T + V = \text{constant}\),
            where \(V\) is the potential energy, and \(T\) is the kinetic energy,
            if we placed a particle at some point where \(V = V_0 > 0\), then the
            force would move it in a direction that <em>increases</em> the potential
            energy. If we are in a harmonic potential, i.e. \(V = x^2 / 2\), then
            the potential energy would increase without limit until \(V > E\) in which
            case the kinetic energy \(T\) would need to be negative, which is impossible.

            This app allows the user to enter an arbitrary scalar function of two
            variables, \(\psi(x, y)\), and calculates its vector gradient.
            The scalar field is shown on the left as a pixelated heat map. The scalar
            function is averaged over the square, so that brighter squares correspond
            to areas where the function has a greater absolute value, and darker squares
            correspond to values closer to zero. The vector field on the left plots
            the direction of the 2-D gradient of the scalar function, given by,
        </p>

        \[\nabla \psi(x, y) = \frac{\partial \psi(x, y)}{\partial x} \mathbf{i}
                            + \frac{\partial \psi(x, y)}{\partial y} \mathbf{j} \]

        <p>
            The vectors, shown as arrows, are normalised, and do not display the magnitude.
            Vectors of length zero, i.e. points such that \(\nabla \psi(x, y) = \mathbf{0}\),
            are displayed as points. The centre of both plots is the coordinate origin \((0, 0)\).
